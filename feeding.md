# Feeding

I feed the fish two times a day.  

- 11:00-14:00 is the time range for the first feeding
- 18:00-20:00 is the time range for the second feeding


Here are the steps to feed:

1. Turn off the equipment

    Hit the Feed Cycle A button in the Apex fusion application.  See the Apex Fusion guide for more details.

2. Put a piece of Nori in the clip



3. Put the frozen food in the dispencer
